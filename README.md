# Viktorija’s Souvenir Tracker (Week 4 Project)

## 📘 Overview
This project is my Week 4 C++ assignment. The program helps users keep track of souvenirs they collect — including the name, quantity, and price per item. It calculates the total cost, saves a formatted report to a file, and includes a menu that lets the user add souvenirs, view the report, or get a collecting recommendation.

## 🧠 Features
- Friendly introduction banner for the user  
- Menu with options:
  1. Add a souvenir  
  2. View souvenir report  
  3. Get collecting level recommendation  
- Input validation to prevent invalid numbers  
- Calculates total cost for each souvenir  
- Displays a nicely formatted summary using `setw` and `setprecision`  
- Saves the summary to a `report.txt` file  
- Uses **selection statements** (`switch`, `if/else`)  
- Includes **loops** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  

## ⚙️ Technical Details
- Written in C++  
- Uses `<iostream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<fstream>`, and `<string>`  
- Avoids magic numbers by using named constants  
- Demonstrates basic control structures and file handling concepts
